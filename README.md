# LEAP FHIR Hearth Demo
LEAP FHIR Proxy Consent Enforcement Point (CES) provides a demonstration of consent enforcement in FHIR transactions. As shown in the below diagram, the web application is implemented as a reverse proxy monitoring the incoming requests and outgoing response to/from a FHIR server. 

![Proxy CES](docs/assets/proxy.png?raw=true)

For every resource being released in the response, the CES pursues the following steps: 

- It identifies the client making the query to receive the resource based on the JWT token assumed to be provided by the client,
- It identifies the patient associated with the resource by navigating the related resources,
- It makes a query to the LEAP Consent Decision Service (CDS) to check whether releasing the resource to the client is permitted by the patient consent, and
- Removes the resource from the results if the patient consent does not permit its release to that client.

## Client Identification
Clients are identified by providing a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by a trusted authority whose public key is known to the CES. This token is expected to be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request as a `Bearer` token and must include the following attributes:

- `actor` recording the identity of the client or the actor on whose behalf the client is making the request. This must be system-code pair based on the input of the LEAP CDS, for example:

```
{
    "system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986",
    "value":"2.16.840.1.113883.20.5"
}
```

- `pou` recording the purpose of use for the transaction. This must be a plain value, for example `TREAT`. If `pou` is not provided it defaults to `TREAT`.

## Test Server
An instance of this service is deployed at: 

`https://leap-fhir-ces.appspot.com` 

This service relies on the test LEAP Consent Decision Service (CDS) and is backed by the test FHIR server located at: 

`https://sdhc-hapi-fhir-leap-wafxyq4bza-uc.a.run.app/fhir`


The trusted public key for this service and the corresponding test private key are provided [here](https://github.com/sdhealthconnect/leap-fhir-ces/tree/master/tests/fixtures). You can use this private key to sign your JWTs when communicating with this server.

### Quick Demo
You can use the following JWT against the [test demo server](https://leap-fhir-ces.appspot.com).
```

```
which includes the following attributes and is signed by the demo private key.
```json
{
  "actor": {
    "system": "urn:ietf:rfc:3986",
    "value": "urn:oid:1.1"
  },
  "pou": "TREAT"
}
```

## Local Setup
The following parameters need to be set as environment variables:

- `FHIR_SERVER_BASE`: the FHIR server base which the CES must protect.

- `UNPROTECTED_RESOURCE_TYPES`: a comma-separated list of resource types that are exempt from consent enforcement, for example `CapabilityStatement`.

- `CDS_HOST`: the URL for the LEAP Consent Decision Service. 

- `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`: the public key of the trusted party to sign client JWTs in PEM format. Note that because of the limitations of environment variables and the `dotenv` package which does not allow newlines in values, all newlines must be turned into literal `\n` and the entire public key file should be made into a single line.

In order to set up this project for development, you need to have `node.js` and `yarn` installed on your system.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.evn` and adjust values according to your local setup.

2. Copy `.env.test.example` to `.env.test` and adjust values according to your local setup.

3. Get the dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```
4. To run the tests call:

```
$ yarn test
```
5. Run the web application:

```
$ yarn start
```
